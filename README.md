THIS is a clone of the landing page of an product design website.
the basic foundation and structure was written in html and was kept as less complicated as it could be. different css properties were used for styling . and various javascript libraries were used like GSAP for animations and Locomotive js for smooth scrolling. the background was given a shade of black to make the look of homepage as simple yet creative.
